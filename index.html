<p>Are you like me, and have spent countless nights alternating between staring at the ceiling, and staring at your clock, watching as the 
hours slowly countdown until dawn?  Have you spent whole nights wondering if god is punishing you, or if, perhaps, you have been placed under a pagan curse for some wrong 
you committed in a past life?  Well lay those fears to rest!  It isn't god, or an ancient eldritch force holding you back.  No, sometimes the problem is a little closer to home,  and together, we will begin a journey to discover how we can avoid sabotaging ourselves
and, perhaps, address the problems and change course.

<p>As you can see from the data provided by the CDC, the average person requires a fair amount of sleep, and almost 1/3 of adults do not get that amount of rest 
during their prime working years.  Suffice to say, there are many of us who suffer from a chronic lack of sleep, regardless of the specific reason which leads to it, and
there are many reasons which lead to it.  Work and family can often be demanding enough on the limited hours we have available within a given day, without adding in 
additional factors, such as genetic debilitations.  Some of the problems can be addressed though, and will be discussed in the Solutions section of this site.
