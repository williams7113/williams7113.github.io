 <p>To provide a concise list of the material in this video, some easy approaches which should always be attempted before seeking further treatment include:</p>
  <ul>
 <li>Exercise, with sunlight, first thing in the morning</li>
 <li>No caffeine consumption at least 6 hours before bedtime</li>
 <li>No alcohol at least 4 hours before bedtime</li>
 <li>Sleep in a cool room</li>
 <li>No food at least 2 hours before bedtime</li>
 <li>No liquids at least 2 hours before bedtime</li>
 <li>Limit blue light exposure after dusk</li>
 <li>Hot shower/bath before bed</li>
 <li>Begin to darken the environment leading into bedtime</li>
 <li>Wear earplugs if in a noisy environment</li>
 <li>Maintain a strict, scheduled bedtime</li>
 <li>Have a bedtime ritual and maintain the ritual</li>
 <li>Fully darken the room at bedtime</li>
 <li>Use noise machines</li>
 <li>Box-breathing</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>As discussed in the above video, sometimes supplements can alleviate insomnia if the rest of the discussed approaches are unsuccessful.  These supplements include:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Melatonin (For people 30 and above)</li>
 <li>GABA</li>
 <li>Magnesium</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Should all of the previous topics prove unhelpful, the final measures are a bit more drastic and are, unfortunately, more and more common these days.  Medications beyond 
 the above supplements, which must be prescribed by a doctor, are available to temporarily alleviate the effects of insomnia.  Many of us know friends
 and family who utilize CPAP machines to treat sleep apnea.  Some of us, perhaps, have friends and family that have had their sleep apnea surgically treated.  All of these approaches
 are beyond the scope of what I would be willing to recommend, and are best left to a medical professional.
